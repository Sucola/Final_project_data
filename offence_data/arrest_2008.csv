Consequently, their state figures for forcible rape (with the exception of Rockford, IL, and Minneapolis and St. Paul, MN) have been estimated for inclusion in this table.  Table 8, Offenses Known to Law Enforcement, provides the reported female forcible rape crime figure. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NOTE:  Although arson data are included in the trend and clearance tables, sufficient data are not available to estimate totals for this offense.  Therefore, no arson data are published in this table.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
